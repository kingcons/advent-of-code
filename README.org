* Advent of Code

** Usage

I wouldn't recommend it. Generally though...

##### Yearly

0. Log back into advent of code and set the `*aoc-session*` in your lisp image.
1. Add a new module to the `advent.asd` system for the current year.
2. Add a new section to the `main.lisp` file for the current year and wire it up.
3. Start a new test file for the year and wire it into `tests.lisp` and the ASDF system.

##### Daily

1. Add a new file component to the system definition in `advent.asd`.
2. At the repl, `(scaffold 2022 02)` or whatever the date is.
3. Add an entry for the new day in the respective year's section in `main.lisp`.
4. Open the tests file for the respective year.

That's it. Get hacking!
